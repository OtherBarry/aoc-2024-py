# Advent of Code 2024

## Requirements

Uses python 3.12, and `uv` as a package/project manager.

## Usage

To run a day, use the following command:

```bash
uv run main.py <day>
```

For example, to run day 1:

```bash
uv run main.py 1
```

Which will output the answers for each part, and the time taken. E.g:

```
Running problems

Problem 1:
        Setup run in 0.23 ms
        Part 1 (0.16 ms): 2815556
        Part 2 (0.17 ms): 23927637

Total time: 1.17 ms
```

You can also specify multiple days to run at once.
